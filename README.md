# Chocothon

Chocothon aims to be an accurate reproduction of the original Macintosh version of the Marathon trilogy, analogous to [https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom](Chocolate Doom).

Chocothon is based on the [http://infinitysource.bungie.org/](Marathon Infinity source code) release.
