# Chocothon

Chocothon aims to be an accurate reproduction of the original Macintosh version of the Marathon trilogy, analogous to [Chocolate Doom](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom).

Chocothon is based on the [Marathon Infinity source code](http://infinitysource.bungie.org/) release.
